## How to meet with a visiting speaker

The best way to meet with a speaker is to coordinate with the listed host in the agenda.  Alternatively, all speaker schedules are posted [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n4gp8plA0egxwAysn3a-c0fOu7RRl0jnZFpqEISqnNY/edit?usp=sharing).

If you are trying to schedule with a speaker several weeks out, please realize that the schedule listed may only be a placeholder and will be subject to the speaker's travel.  If unsure, just leave a note on the bottom indicating interest in meeting.
